This project showcases a comprehensive implementation of Huffman coding, a fundamental technique for lossless data compression. Utilizing Java, the code efficiently 
compresses and decompresses text data while emphasizing modular design and algorithmic clarity.

The implementation leverages a range of data structures including linked lists, nodes, and trees to achieve optimal performance and readability.
Each component serves a distinct purpose:

- **HuffmanCode Class**: This core component orchestrates the Huffman coding process, from constructing the Huffman tree to generating Huffman codes for individual characters.
- It encapsulates the logic for encoding and decoding input text, ensuring seamless compression and decompression operations.

- **LinkedList Class**: This generic linked list implementation facilitates dynamic storage of data elements, crucial for managing frequency nodes, Huffman codes, and other structural
- elements within the project.

- **Node Class**: Acting as the building block for linked list and tree structures, this class encapsulates the concept of a single element within a data structure. It enables efficient
- traversal and manipulation operations across the project.

- **TableNode Class**: This class represents a key component in the Huffman coding process, storing character-frequency pairs alongside their corresponding Huffman codes.
- It streamlines the generation and management of Huffman code tables.

- **HuffmanNode Class**: As the backbone of Huffman tree construction, this class defines the structure of individual nodes within the tree. It facilitates the hierarchical
- organization of characters based on their frequencies, optimizing compression efficiency.

By employing a diverse set of data structures, this project achieves a robust and flexible implementation of Huffman coding, suitable for both educational exploration and practical 
application. The clear separation of concerns and adherence to object-oriented principles ensure maintainability and extensibility, laying the groundwork for future enhancements 
and optimizations.
